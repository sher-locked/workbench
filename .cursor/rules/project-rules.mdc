# Project Rules
----
1. Be very explicit about which part of the [roadmap.md](mdc:spec/roadmap.md) you are building. 
2. Follow coding convention specified in [code-guidelines.md](mdc:spec/code-guidelines.md) when writing, editing and refactoring code. 
3. Critically think through the UI, UX, functionality, composability and maintainability of components, flows and features being built. 
4. Breakdown each part of the [roadmap.md](mdc:spec/roadmap.md), into subparts, an initial version of which is already present. 
5. Ask for explicit confirmation after completing each subpart, and explicit confirmation before moving to the next subpart. 
6. Unit Test, Build, Run, Fix, Handle Edge Cases gracefully while implementing a feature, functionality, UX or bug in the application and ask for explicit intimation that the code is running properly on localhost:3000 before committing any change. 
7. Once you receive my explicit intimation, update all *.md files [roadmap.md](mdc:spec/roadmap.md), [project-spec.md](mdc:spec/project-spec.md) [system-design.md](mdc:spec/system-design.md) [README.md](mdc:clarifi/README.md) with the necessary changes before committing to git in accordance with the changes discussed in that code change commit. 
8. Do NOT run git commands under any situation.
